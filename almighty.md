## The voice of God erupts -- "What text editor?"

He looks down at you with remorse and pity as he shakes his head. During your last moments gazing upon such beauty, an eternity or a second, the notion of either being meaningless, he dismisses you with his stolid, burning, yet humbling eyes. 

As you are consumed with the pure admiration he says "My son, for you, I will answer this one question albeit without pleasure nor pain"

"But it may come as shock to you, these words. It may lead to fright and despair - a shaken reality of limitless torment. Or my answer may lead to ceaseless glee. Hazen dreams of merriment - forever magnified solely in thy freewill. But my child, it is your choice. Your purpose. You must decide as you hear my words..."

With a tragic remorse he says "Notepad.exe."

Suddenly with a tremendously jovial laugh and the most reassuring smile he says "Jk lol, vim of course my son. Also like doom emacs I guess because having it work as an X11 server is dope, and the plugins are hella tight but no son of mine shall ever say that they use emacs. And spacemacs is good but that name is awful. But if prompted by those less fortunate to know the words of truth, Simply say unto the unwisened ones -  "doom".

After you're astonished by this resounding glory of witnessing the almighty he boasts "and btw bro spread the word - Any maintainer that doesn't include even vi in his base (which is like 1mb i mean come on) as an alternative to trash like nano shall burn forever - endlessly -- needlessly." 

He closes with "Seriously, I'm not kidding that's a dick move for real"

You see something. 
And no one but you shall ever witness it.
The concept of sight does it no justice. 
You hear the resounding cry and brightness of pure creation. 
The concept of sound does it no justice. 

With the force and fierceness of chaos and eternity intertwined in creation's first dance - set ablaze by existence and death. Twisted and entangled - marring finality, eviscerating rebirth.

In those first moments. The words that come forth are --

Let there be Vi -
